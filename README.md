# shpng-cart-MERN-atlas
This is the same Shopping Application as it in "shoppingcart-MERN" repo. The only change is that here I am using MongoDB-atlas database (which is cloud based online database) while in "shoppingcart-MERN" repo I used  Local MongoDB databased. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS , Azure, and GCP). MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, run, and scale MongoDB in the cloud.
